          <p>Hi! My name is Lasse and <strong>this is my owner's website</strong>. For the lessons she's following through <strong>Mimo</strong>, she has to add a new blog post by a different author than herself. She told me she doesn't like to use a family member's name or make one up, let alone post a photo of them, so she thought she'd post this under my name, <em>Lasse</em>, and post my photo to show everybody who's reading <strong>how cute I am!</strong></p>
          <p>Have a nice day!</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I started with these <strong>Mimo lessons on programming</strong> to make a website quite a few months ago but took a break because there was lots of other stuff going on. Now that I was working on a small 'creative-writing-type-book', <strong>I need to make my own website!</strong> I thought I'd come back to learn more and I'm loving the lessons again.</p>
          <p>I really hope this works out and I can make <em>a proper website</em> before publishing the book!!</p>
          <p>For something else I'm working on, I have made a beautiful website already, but I used a template to help me out (!); no knowledge of programming needed.. I wouldn't want to change it though, I'm really happy with it, so check it out <a href="https://tatumnewperspective.com">here</a>!</p>
